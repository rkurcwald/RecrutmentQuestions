   Input: "192.168.0.1", "192.168.0.50"  
   Output: 49  
    

    Classes: 
    - [TwoIPAddresses]  
    - [TwoIPAddressesTest]


2.  Write a implementation (optionally tests) of a method that will return number of Objects that is contained in a collection. Collection can contain other collections (do not count collections).  


    Classes:
    - [CollectionCounter]  
    - [CollectionCounterTest]
